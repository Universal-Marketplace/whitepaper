We've all been there before, we use a platform, buy a bunch of stuff, and then realise we are stuck with that platform for life! This centralised application seeks to rectify the plethora of platforms we need to deal with as customers and sellers on a daily basis, by combining them all into a single place. It is intended as a hub for sellers to maintain a platform that helps keep all things simple for their business workflow and their customers. Each platform has its own repository in this organisation.

Centralised application for major platforms to interface with. 

API is created, submitted, and maintained by the platform offering its services. This can be extended by the public through pull requests to the platform's API repositories.

The core of this project is owned and operated by the public, if you are a platform or a seller and would like to become a contributor for your store, send a request.

Features:

- Centralised storefront for all sorts of digital products and services; Games, Game Dev, Software, Streaming Services etc.
- Specific storefronts that interface with the platform's WebAPI to display their native pages.
- Library for all assets owned on all platforms.
- Progressive API that allows platforms to continue to inject their own interests into the marketplace. If controversial or undesireable can be appealed by sellers/developers.
- Direct platform communication hub for requests and communication with the platform
- Templates for graphics that are both universal for the marketplace and specific to the platform.
- Plugins can be developed to extend on Marketplace functionality.
